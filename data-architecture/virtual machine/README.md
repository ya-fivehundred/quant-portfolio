# Virtual Machine: Polygon WebSocket → Pub/Sub Service

## Overview

This directory contains the Python service deployed on a Google Compute Engine (GCE) virtual machine.  
Its purpose is to maintain a continuous data pipeline between the **Polygon.io WebSocket API** and **Google Pub/Sub**, ensuring real-time (or delayed) stock market data is streamed and made available for downstream analytics in BigQuery and Looker.

The service is designed to run without interuption on a lightweight Debian VM, using `systemd` for automatic startup and recovery. A scheduled cloud run function has been added to shutdown the VM during the weekend, when markets are closed.

## VM Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|----------|--------|
| **Instance name** | `finance2` |
| **Region / Zone** | `europe-west9-b` |
| **Machine type** | `e2-small` (2 vCPUs, 2 GB memory) |
| **OS image** | Debian 12 (Bookworm) |
| **Architecture** | x86_64 |
| **Python version** | 3.13 |
| **Status** | Running during open market days via `systemd` and shut down during weekends |

The VM runs a single service responsible for ingesting and publishing market data.

## Service Description

**File:** `websocket_to_pubsub.py`  
**Language:** Python 3.13  
**Dependencies:**  
- `google-cloud-bigquery`  
- `google-cloud-pubsub`  
- `polygon`  
- `pandas` (for temporary DataFrame operations)

### Main Features
- Connects to the **Polygon.io WebSocket API** (`Feed.Delayed`, `Market.Stocks`)
- Fetches ticker lists from **BigQuery** for NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX
- Publishes live price and volume data to **Google Pub/Sub** topics:
  - `xnas-websocket`
  - `xnys-websocket`
  - `xase-websocket`
- Automatically **refreshes ticker lists every 12 hours**
- Handles **reconnections** and **message buffering** gracefully
- Designed as a lightweight **data ingestion layer** for the analytics pipeline

## Systemd Service

The Python process is managed by `systemd` to ensure reliability and automatic restart on failure.


### Service Unit Example
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Polygon WebSocket to Pub/Sub
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=<username>
WorkingDirectory=/home/<username>/polygon
ExecStart=/home/<username>/polygon/venv/bin/python /home/<username>/polygon/websocket_to_pubsub.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Automation and Scheduling

The VM does not run continuously to reduce costs. Its lifecycle is managed using **Cloud Run** and **Cloud Scheduler**.

- Cloud Scheduler triggers a Cloud Run job before U.S. market hours  
- The job starts the VM automatically  
- After market close or during weekends, the job stops the VM  
- Ensures the service runs only when data ingestion is required, optimizing cloud costs  

---

### Monitoring and Logging

All output from the Python service is captured in the **systemd journal**.

- Real-time logs can be viewed with: `journalctl -u polygon.service -f`  
- The service handles reconnections and flushes pending messages on WebSocket errors  
- Each published message includes an ingestion timestamp, ensuring traceability in BigQuery  

---

### Data Flow

The VM acts as the first step in the financial data pipeline:  

**Polygon WebSocket → VM (Python ingestion service) → Pub/Sub → BigQuery → Looker**

- **Polygon WebSocket:** Provides real-time/delayed stock market events  
- **VM Service (Python):** Ingests messages, enriches them, publishes to Pub/Sub  
- **Pub/Sub:** Distributes messages to downstream consumers  
- **BigQuery:** Stores and organizes structured stock market data  
- **Looker:** Visualizes data for analytics and dashboards  

This design balances **reliability**, **cost efficiency**, and **low-latency ingestion**.
